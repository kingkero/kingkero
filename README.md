I have been programming since I got my first copy of an HTML book in 2001. Some milestones are:

- 2003: Started with PHP after learning basic HTML and CSS.
- 2006: Developed a custom CMS that [was online at least until 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20140329002324/http://manutd.ch/) using the PHP framework [Kohana](https://github.com/kohana) and HTML/CSS/JS.
- 2012+: Started getting active on StackOverflow, mostly PHP or HTML/CSS/JS questions. [Now I am in the top 4% of users.](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1557526/kero)
- 2016+: Started getting active in WordPress community. [I contributed to Core](https://profiles.wordpress.org/kingkero/) but mostly did custom plugin & theme implementations for customers.

## Why kero?

One anime I especially liked as a child was [Sgt. Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Frog), better known as **Keroro Gunso**. I really liked the series and so **kero** stuck as a pseudonym for many online services. Due do its brevity it is often already taken, and I'll just use **kingkero** instead (because of the alliteration and reference to Kong; my hybris is just a minor reason in choosing this prefix).
